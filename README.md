## About

Gourmet is a recipe sharing website that allows users to create their own personalized cookbook. Save recipes you love, share new ideas with friends, or add something new that you'd like to try! To view deployed code, click <a href="https://salty-oasis-46016.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.


## Motivation 💡

Our desire was to create a convenient way to save and catalog recipes. The ease of having a repository for frequently-used, easy, go-to recipes will help users plan, shop for, and prepare meals at home. Home-cooked meals will be cheaper, healthier, more convenient, and -- hopefully -- tastier than eating out.

We designed the site with the MVC framework in mind, in hopes of learning more about the MVC pattern as well as  asynchronous programming. The site was also instructive in illustrating the challenges and knowledge required to develop a site on both the front and backend.
